### ERD Diagram

The database is structured around three core entities: Users, Fundraisers, and Pledges.

![ERD Diagram](ERD.png)

**Relationships:**

- One User can create many Fundraisers (one-to-many via `owner` ForeignKey)
- One Fundraiser can have many Pledges (one-to-many via `fundraiser` ForeignKey)
- One User can make many Pledges (one-to-many via `supporter` ForeignKey)
- When a Fundraiser is deleted, all its Pledges are automatically deleted (CASCADE)
- When a User is deleted, all their Fundraisers and Pledges are deleted (CASCADE)
