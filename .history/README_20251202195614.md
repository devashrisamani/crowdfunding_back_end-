**SeedFund** - A sustainability-focused crowdfunding platform

## Planning:

### Concept/Name

**SeedFund** is a crowdfunding platform dedicated to environmental and sustainability initiatives. The platform connects passionate individuals and organizations with community-driven projects that make a positive impact on our planet. From tree planting drives and ocean cleanups to renewable energy projects and wildlife conservation, SeedFund empowers people to support causes they care about.

The name "SeedFund" represents the idea of planting seeds of change - both literally (through environmental projects) and metaphorically (by funding initiatives that grow into larger movements).

**Relationships:**

- One User can create many Fundraisers (one-to-many via `owner` ForeignKey)
- One Fundraiser can have many Pledges (one-to-many via `fundraiser` ForeignKey)
- One User can make many Pledges (one-to-many via `supporter` ForeignKey)
- When a Fundraiser is deleted, all its Pledges are automatically deleted (CASCADE)
- When a User is deleted, all their Fundraisers and Pledges are deleted (CASCADE)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### How to Register a New User

1. **Endpoint:** `POST /users/`
2. **Request Body (JSON):**
   ```json
   {
     "username": "alice",
     "password": "securepassword123",
     "email": "alice@example.com"
   }
   ```
3. **Expected Response:** `201 Created`
   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "username": "alice",
     "email": "alice@example.com",
     "first_name": "",
     "last_name": "",
     "date_joined": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z"

### How to Create a New Fundraiser

1. **First, login to get an authentication token:**

   - **Endpoint:** `POST /api-token-auth/`
   - **Request Body (JSON):**
     ```json
     {
       "username": "alice",
       "password": "securepassword123"
     }
     ```
   - **Expected Response:** `200 OK`
     ```json
     {
       "token": "9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b",
       "user_id": 1,
       "email": "alice@example.com"
     }
     ```
   - **Copy the token value** - you'll need it for the next step!
